# Movie Review DApp

Welcome to the Movie Review DApp project repository! This decentralized application (DApp) leverages the solana blockchain technology to implement a platform for adding and viewing movie reviews on the Solana network. Users can add their reviews for movies and explore reviews added by others in a transparent and decentralized manner.

## Overview
The Movie Review DApp provides users with a user-friendly interface to add and explore movie reviews on the Solana blockchain. It ensures transparency and immutability of reviews through the use of smart contracts. Users can add their reviews, browse existing reviews, and interact with the platform seamlessly.

## Features
- Add movie reviews to the Solana blockchain.
- Explore existing movie reviews added by other users.
- wallet connection.
- Decentralized and transparent review platform.
- Seamless interaction with the blockchain.

## Getting Started
Follow these steps to set up the project locally and start using the Movie Review DApp.

### Prerequisites
- Node.js: Ensure Node.js is installed. Download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/movie-review-dapp.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd movie-review-dapp
    ```
3. Install required npm packages:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

### Usage
1. Start the development server:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
2. Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 to access the DApp.
3. Connect your Solana wallet (e.g., Phantom) to the DApp.
4. Add your movie reviews and explore reviews added by others.

## Smart Contracts
The smart contracts in this project facilitate the movie review process. They handle adding reviews and retrieving reviews from the Solana blockchain. The smart contract was built on the solana playground. Here is the program ID for the smart contract - 2uEDpnwrVU8tkgpDfCTgBopc5BRp3AveYkkcXssdMd4B.


## Frontend
The DApp frontend is built using modern web technologies including Next.js and typescript. It provides an intuitive and interactive user interface for adding and exploring movie reviews.

- Next.js: Powers the DApp's user interface.
- Solana Web3.js: The Solana JavaScript API for smart contract interaction.
- Wallet Integration: Connect your Solana wallet (e.g., Phantom) for secure transactions.
